## Installation
This project is not hosted publicly, but you can clone this repository and run it locally.

The live coding environment I used was [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

## Usage
With the source code loaded onto the coding environment, you should be able to just press play and hear my demo song!
